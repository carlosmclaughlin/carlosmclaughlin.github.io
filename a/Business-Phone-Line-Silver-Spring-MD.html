<p>Still, with so much option readily available, and with so much jargon surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be tough to understand where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are useful and hassle-free; they're not mobile. However, if your business needs to adhere to security policies that require data to be saved on-site, then a hosted service is probably not the very best service. The only difference between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the conventional phone networks (the standard phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>Typically, all you require with cloud hosting services is an acceptable Internet connection and working IP phones.

Your VoIP service provider will take care of moving your number to your brand-new system.</p>
