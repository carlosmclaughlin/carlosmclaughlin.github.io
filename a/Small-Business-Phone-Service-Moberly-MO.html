However, if your business should abide by security guidelines that need information to be stored on-site, then a hosted option is most likely not the very best solution. The only difference in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost of today's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the conventional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
